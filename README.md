# Dynamic-Mapping-of-Progression-of-COVID-19-using-Python

I have created three dynamic maps using time series data of Coronavirus infections around the world using GeoPandas and Pandas Python libraries. 
The time series data are acquired from the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE.

The three different maps contained the 
1.)Global Corona Virus Cases
2.)Global Deaths from Corona Virus
3.)Global Recovery from Corona Virus
